# Traffic and Swell Visualizer

This application displays information about the level of swell and traffic in the Venetian canals for recent conditions as well as for periods since 2001. Colors closer to green indicate lower levels of traffic and swell, while colors closer to red indicate higher levels. It is important to note that green levels are not necessarily safe for the canals.

## Documentation
This application uses [CKdata](https://ckdata.herokuapp.com/) to get the data it's visualizing. CKdata in turn works with [this firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/1/project/firebase-cityknowledge/overview) database.
the app is written in js and is static. it is deployed on [vercel](https://vercel.com/vpcprojects/traffic-swell).

on moreinfo page, the app tries to draw charts based on info saved on google drive, using google charts api (which right now does not work since the api is deprecated)
